# 📊 Image Segmentation Using Clustering

## Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive approach to **Image Segmentation** by leveraging unsupervised **Clustering** techniques. Segmentation is a crucial task in image analysis, helping divide an image into meaningful segments based on similar attributes. In this project, we explore two widely used clustering algorithms—**K-means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**—for segmenting images.

## 🧠 What is Image Segmentation?
Image Segmentation refers to partitioning an image into regions or groups of pixels, often to make an image easier to analyze or extract important features. It plays a pivotal role in various fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, and object detection.

### Why Clustering for Segmentation?
Clustering is an **unsupervised learning** method, meaning it doesn't require labeled data. By grouping similar pixels, it becomes an effective and efficient way to segment an image into regions with similar characteristics.

## 🛠 Features of the Repository
1. **Preprocessing Images**: Load and preprocess images, including resizing and normalizing for better performance.
2. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - **K-Means Clustering**: Efficiently partitions the image into _K_ clusters based on pixel intensities.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Performs segmentation by creating a hierarchy of clusters.
3. **Visualization**: View the segmented images and compare the results of K-means and Hierarchical clustering.

## 🔍 How It Works
- **Step 1**: Load an image 🖼️ from a dataset or external source.
- **Step 2**: Preprocess the image by normalizing pixel values.
- **Step 3**: Apply **K-means** or **Hierarchical** clustering algorithms.
- **Step 4**: Visualize the segmented image to observe how clusters separate regions of the image.

## ⚙️ Algorithms in Detail
1. **K-Means Clustering** 🌀
   - Clusters the image pixels into a predefined number of _K_ clusters based on their RGB values.
   - The algorithm iteratively adjusts cluster centroids to minimize intra-cluster variance.
  
2. **Hierarchical Clustering** 🌲
   - Builds a tree-like structure of clusters, progressively merging clusters based on pixel similarity.
   - It works by either an **agglomerative** (bottom-up) or **divisive** (top-down) approach.
